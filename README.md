## Installation

Apart from [brew](http://brew.sh/). This requires that both npm and grunt-cli are installed. After setting the
appropriate proxy settings, on OS X this can be accomplished with:

```bash
brew install npm
npm install -g grunt
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

In order to generate documentation, you will need a few other packages:

```bash
npm install
grunt setup
```

## Updating documentation

Before updating these documents, please familiarize yourself with the official [Swagger Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md) and [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/).

Also see:

To generate HTML (`site/index.html`), run:

```bash
grunt build
```

If you wish to view live updates while you are editing, the following command will open the generated code in your browser and regenerate the HTML whenever you update the source:

```bash
grunt server
```

When adding this repository to a CI server where you only want to test the Swagger without generating HTML, use:

```bash
grunt test
```
